# SRER Rainfall Manipulation Experiment

This repo stores and controls scripts for Santa Rita Experimental Range
rainfall manipulation velvet mesquite establishment experiment. This
work is funded by the US Department of Agriculture National Institute of
Food and Agriculture under grant GRANT11886574 (award 2016-67013-24932)
titled, "Exotic grass and woody plant encroachment in Southwestern
Rangelands: mechanisms of invasion and opportunities for containment".

*Scripts are meant to be ran in order (1-12). Figure 1 is based on
environmental data that is largely in Appendix S1. Figure 1 code is in
the "12_srer_rainout_data_vis-env.R" script as well as all the
supplemental figures and associated environmental variable statistics*.

## Abstract

1. Woody plant proliferation and the transformation of grasslands to shrublands and woodlands is occurring globally. Once established woody plants may be long-lived and highly persistent. Shrub recruitment is therefore a critical first step and ‘bottleneck’ in the grassland-to-shrubland transformation process. Shrub recruitment in drylands is often assumed to be episodic with regard to precipitation (PPT). However, seed/seedling predation and livestock grazing are also known influences on shrub establishment. Relatively little is known regarding the relative importance of these factors and how they might interact with each other. 
2. We experimentally manipulated PPT, seed/seedling predation, and grass defoliation (proxy for seedling-grass competition) over a 3-y period to address their influence on the recruitment of *Prosopis velutina* (velvet mesquite), a native shrub encroacher of Sonoran Desert grasslands. 
3. Above-average growing season PPT was not required for shrub recruitment; seed/seedling predators reduced, but did not prevent, recruitment; and grass defoliation, and by inference reduced grass competition, was not a requisite for shrub seedling recruitment. Although levels of recruitment varied, no combination of PPT (including extreme drought) or herbivory (including full access to ants/small mammal seed/seedling predators and simulated heavy grazing) prevented shrub seed germination/seedling survival. 
4. *Synthesis and Applications.* We pose that *P. velutina* establishment in grasslands is not episodic *per se* in that it can readily occur (i) in years with average and below-average PPT, (ii) across a wide range of seed/seedling predator abundances, and (iii) in the absence of grass defoliation. Shrub establishment in drylands can therefore be expected to continue in the face of projected changes in regional climate. Knowledge of how PPT and herbivory interact to mediate shrub recruitment will inform vegetation management and monitoring efforts including the timing and frequency of interventions needed to maintain grassland ecosystems.
